# HDSkullGun
"Why carry guns when you can *be* the gun?"

This mod adds a set of head-mounted weapon implants, inspired by the Skullgun from Cruelty Squad. 

The standard Skull Gun works similarly to the original, firing small exploding bullets that can destroy walls and doors. There are two other versions that launch fire and plasma blasts instead. All three can be carried together. 

Each shot cost the user 2 points of health. The flame and plasma variants can also overheat and burn the user if fired too quickly.

To use the skullguns, they must be equipped from the inventory. You have to add them to your loadout in order to get access to them. They cannot be found in the wild.

Loadout Codes:

- skg - Skull Gun
- skf - Skull Flamer
- skb - Skull Buster
